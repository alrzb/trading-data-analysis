    "# Final Project: Analyzing International Trade Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a dataset that contains export/import data over several years, broken down by country. Your task is to clean, analyze, and visualize this data to provide insights into global trade patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Extract and Rename Columns:*\n",
    "        Identify the relevant columns that represent the actual data.\n",
    "        Rename the columns appropriately (e.g., Country, Year_2008_2009, Year_2009_2010, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Handle Missing Values:*\n",
    "        Identify and appropriately handle any missing values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Convert Data Types:*\n",
    "        Convert columns to appropriate data types, such as converting numeric columns from strings to floats or integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Summary Statistics:*\n",
    "        Generate summary statistics for the dataset, such as mean, median, and total exports for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Top 10 Exporting Countries:*\n",
    "        Identify the top 10 exporting countries for each year based on total export values.\n",
    "    - *Growth Rate Analysis:*\n",
    "        Calculate the year-over-year growth rate for each country and identify the countries with the highest growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Visualization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Bar Charts:*\n",
    "        Create bar charts to visualize the top 10 exporting countries for a selected year.\n",
    "    - *Line Charts:*\n",
    "        Create line charts to show the export trends over time for selected countries.\n",
    "    - *Heatmaps:*\n",
    "        Generate a heatmap to show the correlation between different years' export data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Data Aggregation:*\n",
    "        Write a function to aggregate data for a given list of countries and return the total exports over the specified period.\n",
    "    - *Country Comparison:*\n",
    "        Write a function that  compares the export growth of two selected countries over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Report:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prepare a report summarizing your findings, including tables and charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Provide insights and recommendations based on the data analysis. What do the trends suggest about global trade?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaned Dataset:**\n",
    "    The final cleaned and processed dataset should be submitted as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Code:**\n",
    "    Submit the Python code used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Ensure that the code is well-commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Report:**\n",
    "    A PDF report summarizing your analysis, findings, and any recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presentation (Optional):**\n",
    "    A brief presentation (e.g., PowerPoint) highlighting the key points of your analysis."
